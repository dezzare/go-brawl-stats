## Why?
I'm a lawyer in transition to a dev career,
and a senior Information Systems Development student,
with no job experience in the area.
Listening/reading all the tips for "How to get experience" or
"How to learn code", I created this project.

Therefore, the main purpose of this project for study is (but not limited to):

    * API client
    * API server
    * CLI application
    * Go standard lib
    * Data structures
      * Map
        * map[string]int
        * map[string]struct
        * map[string]map[string]string
      * Slices/Arrays
      * []Byte
      * Structs
        * Nested structs
        * []struct
        * Struct Methods
    * Pointers
    * JSON
      * Read a JSON response
      * Read a JSON file
      * Parse []Byte to JSON
      * Parse JSON to []Byte
      * Save JSON file
    * Data manipulation
    * Sorting Algorithm
    * Abstraction
      * to build Requests
